### Governors/policies (performance vs. idle consumption):

Original governor settings:

    cpufreq-policy0: ondemand / 1800 MHz (conservative ondemand userspace powersave performance schedutil)
    cpufreq-policy4: ondemand / 408 MHz (conservative ondemand userspace powersave performance schedutil)
    cpufreq-policy6: ondemand / 408 MHz (conservative ondemand userspace powersave performance schedutil)
    dmc: dmc_ondemand / 528 MHz (rknpu_ondemand dmc_ondemand userspace powersave performance simple_ondemand)
    fb000000.gpu: simple_ondemand / 300 MHz (rknpu_ondemand dmc_ondemand userspace powersave performance simple_ondemand)
    fdab0000.npu: rknpu_ondemand / 1000 MHz (rknpu_ondemand dmc_ondemand userspace powersave performance simple_ondemand)

Tuned governor settings:

    cpufreq-policy0: performance / 1800 MHz
    cpufreq-policy4: performance / 2400 MHz
    cpufreq-policy6: performance / 2400 MHz
    dmc: performance / 2112 MHz
    fb000000.gpu: performance / 1000 MHz
    fdab0000.npu: performance / 1000 MHz

Status of performance related policies found below /sys:

    /sys/devices/platform/fb000000.gpu/power_policy: [coarse_demand] always_on

Kernel 5.10.110 is not latest 5.10.168 LTS that was released on 2023-02-15.

Please check https://endoflife.date/linux for details. It is somewhat likely
that a lot of exploitable vulnerabilities exist for this kernel as well as
many unfixed bugs. Better upgrade to a supported version ASAP.

But this version string doesn't matter since this is not an official LTS Linux
from kernel.org. This device runs a Rockchip vendor/BSP kernel.

This kernel is based on a mixture of Android GKI and other sources. Also some
community attempts to do version string cosmetics might have happened, see
https://tinyurl.com/2p8fuubd for example. To examine how far away this 5.10.110
is from an official LTS of same version someone would have to reapply Rockchip's
thousands of patches to a clean 5.10.110 LTS.
